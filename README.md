### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student from Chile who is passionate about Data Science and IOS development. This repo holds some of my work that showcases how I go around data analysis and coding in general.

### Data area
In general, I've been working with data as a professional. I've served as a Data Consultant, giving me experience in both Data Engineering and Analysis. However, my thirst for growth and advancement propels me forward. This is why I've undertaken courses at DataCamp, where I successfully completed a [Data Science track](https://www.datacamp.com/completed/statement-of-accomplishment/track/de76dd2fdc35594a23786029f235f384900b8b8f) using Python. I've been actively engaged in various Python projects ever since. Additionally, I have experience in Cloud computing, specifically working with Snowflake. You can verify my certifications on my Linkedin [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisinostrozaf/).

### IOS Development
As much as i like DS, i also like coding, and the way i've decided to apply it is with mobile development, focused on ios. I'm a beginner in this area so i'm gonna be learning a lot to finally find a job. Feel free to visit my [ios development](https://github.com/luisinostrozaf/ios_development) repo. If this way goes well, i wanna learn about flutter and be able to develop multiplatform apps.
