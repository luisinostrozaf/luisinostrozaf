### Data Science
In general, ive been working with data as a professional. Ive been a Data Consultant, so i have experience as Data Engineer and Analyst. But i want to go to the next level, thats why i've been doing courses at data camp, where i completed a [track](https://www.datacamp.com/completed/statement-of-accomplishment/track/de76dd2fdc35594a23786029f235f384900b8b8f) of data science using python, and been working in some projects with python since then. Also i have experience in Cloud working with Snowflake, you can see my certifications on my Linkedin [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisinostrozaf/).

### IOS Development
As much as i like DS, i also like coding, and the way i've decided to apply it is with mobile development, focused on ios. I'm a beginner in this area so i'm gonna be learning a lot to finally find a job. Feel free to visit my [ios development](https://github.com/luisinostrozaf/ios_development) repo. If this way goes well, i wanna learn about flutter and be able to develop multiplatform apps.

You may be wondering, why am i into 2 completely different areas? and the reason is because i'm just finishing my university career, and i wanna experience a data job, aswell as a developer job, to find my true passion and what i want to do for the rest of my life, i mean it's a really important decision in every's life.
