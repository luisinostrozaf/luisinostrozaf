### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

________________________
I'm a student from Chile who is passionate about Data Science and iOS development. This repo holds some of my work that showcases how I go around data analysis and coding in general. If you wish to seek more about me, feel free to visit my [website](https://luisinostrozaf.github.io)(under construction).

### Data area
In general, I've been working with data as a professional. I've served as a Data Consultant, giving me experience in both Data Engineering and Analysis. However, my thirst for growth and advancement propels me forward. This is why I've undertaken courses at DataCamp, where I successfully completed a [Data Science track](https://www.datacamp.com/completed/statement-of-accomplishment/track/de76dd2fdc35594a23786029f235f384900b8b8f) using Python. I've been actively engaged in various Python projects ever since. Additionally, I have experience in Cloud computing, specifically working with Snowflake. You can verify my certifications on my Linkedin [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisinostrozaf/).

### iOS Development
As much as I enjoy data science, I also have a strong interest in coding. My chosen avenue for applying this interest is mobile development, with a specific focus on iOS. I'm currently a beginner in this field, which means I'll be on a learning journey to prepare myself for future job opportunities. Please feel free to visit my [iOS development](https://github.com/luisinostrozaf/ios_development) repository. If this path progresses as planned, my next goal is to learn about Flutter and gain the ability to develop cross-platform applications.

You may be wondering, why am I interested in two completely different areas? The reason is that I'm just finishing my university career, and I want to gain experience in both a data-related job and a developer role to discover my true passion and decide what I want to pursue for the rest of my life. Making this choice is a significant decision in everyone's life. You can reach me at my business email: luis.inostrozaf@gmail.com. Feel free to contact me.
